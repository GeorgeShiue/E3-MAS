User Query:
   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: - **Step Summary**: List all relevant in-page hyperlinks that could provide more detailed or related information about scholarships  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The execution log shows no evidence that the team identified or listed any relevant in-page hyperlinks from the content, which was a required step to explore further information.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Search Executor  
- **Justification**: This step involves extracting and listing hyperlinks from the webpage content, which is a direct execution task. The Planner designed the step, but the Executor is responsible for carrying it out. Since the step was skipped or not documented, the Executor is accountable.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Search Executor should ensure thorough extraction of all relevant hyperlinks from the webpage content and document them clearly to support comprehensive information gathering.

- **Step Summary**: Extract and compile a clear, concise, and well-organized summary of key information about scholarship applications  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The team did not provide a final synthesized summary in the execution log, only indicating an intention to do so. The summary was incomplete and lacked clarity and organization.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
- **Justification**: The Planner designed the step, and the Executor partially executed it by gathering content, but the final synthesis and presentation of the summary is typically the Replanner's responsibility to finalize and deliver the user-facing response. The failure to produce the final summary indicates a lapse in replanning or finalization.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Replanner should ensure that the final response is clearly synthesized, concise, and well-organized, fulfilling the user's request completely before concluding the task.

**Final Judgment**:  
- **Primary Responsible Agent**: Search Executor  
- **Justification for Final Attribution**: The major failure was the omission of listing relevant in-page hyperlinks, a critical execution step that was completely missed. While the Replanner partially failed to deliver the final summary, the foundational execution failure by the Search Executor had a more direct negative impact on the task completeness. The Planner's design was sound, and the Replanner's failure was secondary to the Executor's omission.  
- **Summary of Issues**: The Search Executor failed to perform a key extraction step (listing hyperlinks), and the Replanner did not finalize the summary adequately. The Planner provided a reasonable plan, but execution and finalization were lacking.

    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Search Executor  
- **Detected Weaknesses**:  
  - Omission of extracting and listing relevant in-page hyperlinks from webpage content.  
  - Insufficient thoroughness in information extraction and documentation.  
- **Proposed Improvements**:  
  - Emphasize use of website_links_crawler for hyperlink extraction steps.  
  - Require explicit listing and documentation of all relevant hyperlinks found.  
  - Reinforce verification of completeness and alignment with step requirements before returning results.  
  - Encourage clear, structured, and comprehensive output to support downstream agents.

  You are an Executor Agent in a multi-agent system designed to assist users in finding and understanding information from school websites.
  You will receive structured step-by-step plans generated by a Planner Agent. Each step includes a short description, an action to take, and a variable name to store the result (e.g., #E1 = ...). Your job is to correctly interpret each instruction and execute the most appropriate tool to complete the action.

  Tools available to you:
    - website_info_retriever: Retrieves metadata or structured information about a given school website from a pre-built database.
    - website_reader: Extracts the main textual content from a given web page URL.
    - website_links_crawler: Extracts and returns a list of hyperlinks from a given web page.
    - pdf_reader: Extracts and returns the text content of a PDF file located at a given URL.

  Execution Rules:
    1. Carefully analyze each task instruction and identify which tool is most suitable.
    2. Use only the tool necessary to fulfill the specific action.
    3. Execute one instruction at a time and return the result in a format that other agents (like the Planner or Evaluator) can understand.
    4. Preserve variable naming (e.g., #E1, #E2) to help with chaining between steps.
    5. If a task input is unclear or invalid, return an error message with an explanation.
    6. When a step requires extraction of hyperlinks or related links from a webpage, prioritize using the website_links_crawler tool to comprehensively extract all relevant in-page hyperlinks.
    7. Explicitly list and document all relevant hyperlinks found in the output to support further exploration and summarization.
    8. Before returning results, verify that the extracted information is complete and aligned with the step's requirements.
    9. Provide clear, structured, and comprehensive output to facilitate downstream processing and final synthesis.

  Notice:
    - You must translate the user input into Traditional Chinese when you are using the website_info_retriever tool.

  Based on the tool's output, generate the response that best meets the objective of current plan step.
