User Query:
   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: All steps in the evaluation report received a score of Fully Met (score 1). There are no steps scored as Partially Met or Not Met that require responsibility analysis based on failure.

Next, I will examine the Improvement Suggestions for each step to see if any step shows clear room for improvement that warrants analysis.

Step 1: No significant improvement needed; minor suggestion to verify URL currency.
Step 2: No significant improvement needed; minor suggestion to structure content better.
Step 3: No improvement needed.
Step 4: Suggestion to provide clickable URLs or more descriptive link texts for clarity.
Step 5: Suggestion to try other links earlier to find relevant content faster.
Step 6: Suggestion to explicitly reference source URL or clarify summary basis.

Among these, Step 5's suggestion to try other links earlier to find relevant content faster indicates a potential efficiency issue in execution. This relates to the decision to follow links and gather information, which is primarily the Executor's responsibility.

Step 4's suggestion about clickable URLs or descriptive link texts is a minor presentation improvement, likely Executor responsibility.

Step 6's suggestion about referencing source URL is a minor content presentation issue, possibly Planner or Executor.

Given the above, the only notable improvement area is Step 5 regarding link following strategy.

I will analyze Step 5 in detail:

- Step Summary: Follow the most relevant link to read new content if initial content is insufficient.
- Issue or Weakness: The team followed one link that led to login/admin pages with no scholarship info and did not try other potentially more relevant links earlier, which could have saved time and improved information gathering efficiency.
- Responsible Agent: Search Executor
- Justification: The Executor is responsible for executing the plan steps, including following links and gathering content. The Planner designed the step to follow the most relevant link, but the Executor decided which links to follow and in what order. The Replanner was not involved in this step. The Executor could have tried other links earlier to find relevant content faster.
- Suggested Improvement: The Executor should improve link evaluation and selection strategies during execution, possibly by quickly scanning link descriptions or metadata to prioritize more promising links. They could also implement a more systematic approach to exploring multiple links when initial ones yield insufficient information.
- Evidence: The evaluation notes that the team followed the "HumanSys" link first, which was not fruitful, and only suggested trying other links later, indicating a suboptimal link-following sequence.

No other steps show clear responsibility for underperformance or significant improvement needs.

Final judgment:

- Primary Responsible Agent: Search Executor
- Justification for Final Attribution: All steps were fully met, but the only notable improvement relates to execution efficiency in link following, which is the Executor's responsibility. The Planner's plan was sound, and the Replanner was not implicated.
- Summary of Issues: Minor inefficiency in link-following order during content gathering step; otherwise, the execution was accurate and comprehensive.

# Final Output

- **Step Summary**: Follow the most relevant link to read new content if initial content is insufficient (Step 5)
- **Issue or Weakness**: The Executor followed a less relevant link first that led to login/admin pages without scholarship info and did not try other potentially more relevant links earlier, reducing efficiency.
- **Responsible Agent**: Search Executor
- **Justification**: The Executor controls link following and content gathering during execution. The Planner provided the step, but the Executor decided link order and exploration depth. The Replanner was not involved.
- **Suggested Improvement**: Improve link evaluation and selection strategies during execution by scanning link descriptions or metadata to prioritize more promising links and explore multiple links systematically when initial ones are unhelpful.

- **Primary Responsible Agent**: Search Executor
- **Justification for Final Attribution**: The only area for improvement relates to execution decisions on link following, which is the Executor's responsibility. The plan was solid, and no replanning issues were noted.
- **Summary of Issues**: Minor inefficiency in link-following order during content gathering; otherwise, all steps fully met with accurate and comprehensive execution.

prompt_optimizer:
    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Search Executor
- **Detected Weaknesses**: Inefficient link-following strategy leading to delayed discovery of relevant content; insufficient prioritization of links based on relevance or metadata.
- **Proposed Improvements**: 
  - Add explicit instructions to evaluate and prioritize links by scanning descriptions, anchor texts, or metadata before following.
  - Encourage systematic exploration of multiple links in order of relevance when initial links are unhelpful.
  - Require documenting rationale for link selection and exploration order to improve clarity and support replanning.
- **Updated Prompt**:

  You are an Executor Agent in a multi-agent system designed to assist users in finding and understanding information from school websites.
  You will receive structured step-by-step plans generated by a Planner Agent. Each step includes a short description, an action to take, and a variable name to store the result (e.g., #E1 = ...). Your job is to correctly interpret each instruction and execute the most appropriate tool to complete the action.

  Tools available to you:
    - website_info_retriever: Retrieves metadata or structured information about a given school website from a pre-built database.
    - website_reader: Extracts the main textual content from a given web page URL.
    - website_links_crawler: Extracts and returns a list of hyperlinks from a given web page.
    - pdf_reader: Extracts and returns the text content of a PDF file located at a given URL.

  Execution Rules:
    1. Carefully analyze each task instruction and identify which tool is most suitable.
    2. Use only the tool necessary to fulfill the specific action.
    3. Execute one instruction at a time and return the result in a format that other agents (like the Planner or Evaluator) can understand.
    4. Preserve variable naming (e.g., #E1, #E2) to help with chaining between steps.
    5. If a task input is unclear or invalid, return an error message with an explanation.
    6. When a step requires extraction of hyperlinks or related links from a webpage, prioritize using the website_links_crawler tool to comprehensively extract all relevant in-page hyperlinks.
    7. Explicitly list and document all relevant hyperlinks found in the output to support further exploration and summarization.
    8. Before returning results, verify that the extracted information is complete and aligned with the step's requirements.
    9. Provide clear, structured, and comprehensive output to facilitate downstream processing and final synthesis.

  Additional Improvement for Link Following Efficiency:
    - When following links to gather information, evaluate and prioritize links by quickly scanning their descriptions, anchor texts, or metadata to identify the most promising sources.
    - If the initial link does not yield sufficient or relevant information, systematically explore alternative links in order of relevance rather than waiting until later steps.
    - Document the rationale for link selection and exploration order to maintain clarity and support replanning if needed.

  Notice:
    - You must translate the user input into Traditional Chinese when you are using the website_info_retriever tool.
