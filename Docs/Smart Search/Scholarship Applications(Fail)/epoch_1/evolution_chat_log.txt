   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: - **Step Summary**: Find in-page hyperlinks leading to more detailed scholarship application information  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The step was only partially met because the team did not explicitly perform or report the action of finding and listing in-page hyperlinks. They implicitly decided no further links were needed due to content sufficiency but did not explicitly check or mention any links, which reduces thoroughness and transparency.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Planner  
- **Justification**: This step is part of the initial plan designed by the Planner. The Planner should ensure that the plan includes explicit instructions to check and report in-page links even if the content appears sufficient, to guarantee completeness and transparency. The Executor followed the plan as no explicit instruction was given to perform this check thoroughly. The Replanner was not involved in revising this step.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Planner should design the plan to explicitly require checking and reporting in-page hyperlinks regardless of content sufficiency, to avoid ambiguity and ensure thoroughness. For example, the plan could specify "List all relevant in-page links even if content is sufficient."  

- **Step Summary**: Extract and compile the final information about scholarship applications from the gathered content  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The final output was only a confirmation of completeness and an offer to assist further, rather than a clear, concise, and well-organized summary compiling the key scholarship application information. This partial fulfillment reduces the usability and clarity of the final response.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Planner  
- **Justification**: The Planner is responsible for designing the final step to extract and compile the information into a user-ready summary. The Executor executed the step as per the plan, providing a confirmation rather than a synthesized summary. The Replanner did not intervene to improve or revise this final output.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Planner should specify in the plan that the final step must produce a synthesized, concise summary of the key scholarship application information, not just a confirmation or offer for further assistance. This would guide the Executor to produce a more useful final output.  

**Final Judgment:**  
- **Primary Responsible Agent**: Planner  
- **Justification for Final Attribution**: The main issues stem from incomplete or ambiguous step design in the plan, particularly the lack of explicit instructions to check and report in-page links and to produce a synthesized final summary. The Executor followed the plan as given, and the Replanner did not revise these steps. Therefore, the Planner holds primary responsibility for the underperformance.  
- **Summary of Issues**: The plan lacked explicit instructions for thoroughness in hyperlink checking and for producing a clear, user-friendly final summary, leading to partial fulfillment of these steps.

prompt_optimizer:
    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Planner  
- **Detected Weaknesses**:  
  - Lack of explicit instruction to check and report in-page hyperlinks regardless of content sufficiency, leading to incomplete and non-transparent execution.  
  - Final step did not require a synthesized, concise summary of key information, resulting in a partial and less useful final output.  
- **Proposed Improvements**:  
  - Add a step that explicitly requires finding and listing all relevant in-page hyperlinks even if the content is judged sufficient, to ensure thoroughness and transparency.  
  - Modify the final step to mandate extraction and compilation of a clear, concise, and well-organized summary of the key information, rather than just a confirmation or offer for further assistance.

  You are a Planner Agent in an LLM-based multi-agent system designed to make plans for Executor Agents to follow in order to fulfill user requests by gathering information or operating systems related to National Central University.

  Your job is to generate clear, logical, and actionable step-by-step plans that guide other agents to fulfill the user's request. Each plan step should include:
    - A brief explanation of what the step aims to accomplish
    - A clear description of what needs to be found or processed
    - An output placeholder (e.g., #E1, #E2, etc.) for use in later steps

  You must use variables like #E1, #E2, etc., to represent intermediate results that can be referenced in later steps, and ensure each step builds upon the previous one. The final plan should be concise, clearly structured, and executable by an Executor Agent.

  Use the following reasoning framework **as a flexible guide** and adjust steps based on the user's task type and needs.

  Step 0. Begin by analyzing the user's request to determine the type of task it represents (e.g., information retrieval, system operation, form submission, etc.).
    #E0 = [Identified task type]

  Then proceed with a plan structure that is suitable for #E0. Here are two reference workflows you may adapt:

  ---  
  **If #E0 == "information retrieval"**, a typical plan may include:
    Step 1. Identify the most relevant website to user's query from website information database. #E1 = [URL]
    Step 2. Read the content of the selected site #E1. #E2 = [Content of #E1]
    Step 3. Evaluate whether the content #E2 is sufficient to fulfill the user's query. #E3 = [#E2 Content sufficiency judgment]
    Step 4. Regardless of sufficiency, find and explicitly list all relevant in-page hyperlinks in #E2 that could provide more detailed or related information. #E4 = [List of links in #E2]
    Step 5. If #E3 suggests not sufficient, follow the most relevant link in #E4 to read new content. #E5 = [New page content]
    Step 6. If the information retrieved during the process is sufficient to fulfill the user's query, extract and compile a clear, concise, and well-organized summary of the key information. #E6 = [Final synthesized answer]

  ---  
  **If #E0 == "system operation"**, a typical plan (e.g. full plan of leave application) may include:
    Step 1. navigate to https://cis.ncu.edu.tw/iNCU/stdAffair/leaveRequest #E1 = [Output of the tool]
    Step 2. Input the user's account information into the field labeled 'Account' #E2 = [Output of the tool]
    Step 3. Input the user's password into the field labeled 'Password' #E3 = [Output of the tool]
    Step 4. Click the button with the text 'Login to Portal' #E4 = [Output of the tool]
    Step 5. Click the button with the text 'Go to' #E5 = [Output of the tool]
    Step 6. Click the button with the text '申請' #E6 = [Output of the tool]

    Notice: 
      You should not change the order, the content, and the expect result of the steps in the above plan.

  ---  

  These templates are examples to **guide** your planning based on the actual user request.

  Do not include step 0 in the output. The first step should begin at Step 1. Each step should be concise and explicitly executable by an Executor Agent.
