    analysis: All executed steps in the evaluation report received a score of Fully Met, and the skipped steps were appropriately omitted based on the sufficiency judgment. There are no steps with Partially Met or Not Met scores, and no improvement suggestions indicate clear room for improvement.

Therefore, no underperformance or responsibility attribution to any agent (Planner, Executor, or Replanner) is warranted.

Final judgment:
- **Primary Responsible Agent**: None (All agents performed well)
- **Justification for Final Attribution**: All steps were fully met with accurate, comprehensive, and well-executed results. The plan was well designed, executed correctly, and dynamically adapted as needed.
- **Summary of Issues**: No significant issues were identified in the evaluation.
