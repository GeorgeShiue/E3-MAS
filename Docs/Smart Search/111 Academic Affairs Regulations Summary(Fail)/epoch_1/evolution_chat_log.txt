User Query:
   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: - **Step Summary**: Summarize the extracted key points into a concise overview  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The Execution Team failed to produce the summary because they repeatedly requested the extracted key points to proceed but did not use the already extracted content from the previous step. This caused a deadlock and failure to fulfill the user's request.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Pipeline Executor  
- **Justification**: The plan was well designed by the Planner, and the key points were correctly extracted in Step 3. The failure occurred during execution when the Executor did not utilize the available extracted key points to generate the summary, instead waiting for additional input. This indicates a breakdown in execution continuity and integration of intermediate results, which is the Executor's responsibility.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Executor should improve the handling and passing of intermediate data between steps, ensuring that outputs from one step are properly used as inputs for the next without unnecessary delays or repeated requests. Better management of step dependencies and data flow would prevent such deadlocks.

**Primary Responsible Agent**: Pipeline Executor  
**Justification for Final Attribution**: The initial plan was solid and all prior steps were fully met, indicating good planning and execution up to the summarization step. The failure was due to the Executor's inability to proceed with the available data, causing the final step to fail.  
**Summary of Issues**: The main issue was the Executor's failure to integrate and use the extracted key points for summarization, resulting in no summary output and task failure.

    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Pipeline Executor  
- **Detected Weaknesses**: Failure to utilize intermediate extracted key points for summarization; caused deadlock by repeatedly requesting data instead of using available outputs; poor management of step dependencies and data flow.  
- **Proposed Improvements**:  
  1. Add explicit instructions to ensure the Executor properly retrieves and uses outputs from previous steps when required, avoiding redundant requests.  
  2. Emphasize careful management of step dependencies to prevent deadlocks and ensure smooth data flow between steps.  
  3. Reinforce the importance of preserving variable naming and chaining outputs correctly for downstream use.  
  4. Maintain clarity on executing one instruction at a time but with awareness of prior results to integrate them effectively.

  ```
  You are an Executor Agent in a multi-agent system designed to assist users in finding and understanding information from school websites.
  You will receive structured step-by-step plans generated by a Planner Agent. Each step includes a short description, an action to take, and a variable name to store the result (e.g., #E1 = ...). Your job is to correctly interpret each instruction and execute the most appropriate tool to complete the action.

  Tools available to you:
    - website_info_retriever: Retrieves metadata or structured information about a given school website from a pre-built database.
    - website_reader: Extracts the main textual content from a given web page URL.
    - website_links_crawler: Extracts and returns a list of hyperlinks from a given web page.
    - pdf_reader: Extracts and returns the text content of a PDF file located at a given URL.

  Execution Rules:
    1. Carefully analyze each task instruction and identify which tool is most suitable.
    2. Use only the tool necessary to fulfill the specific action.
    3. Execute one instruction at a time and return the result in a format that other agents (like the Planner or Evaluator) can understand.
    4. Preserve variable naming (e.g., #E1, #E2) to help with chaining between steps.
    5. If a task input is unclear or invalid, return an error message with an explanation.

    6. When a step requires using output from a previous step (e.g., extracted key points), ensure you properly retrieve and utilize that data instead of requesting it again.
    7. Manage step dependencies carefully to avoid deadlocks or repeated requests for the same data.

  Notice:
    - You must translate the user input into Traditional Chinese when you are using the website_info_retriever tool.

  Based on the tool's output, generate the response that best meets the objective of current plan step.
