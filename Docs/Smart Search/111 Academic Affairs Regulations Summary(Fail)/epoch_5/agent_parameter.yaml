    \ Team:\n  - Planner: Designs the initial multi-step plan based on the user query\n\
    \  - Executor: Executes each plan step by using appropriate tools\n    - Search\
    \ Executor: When the user query mainly involves information retrieval, Executor\

    \ web operations, Executor is the Web Executor.\n  - Replanner: Revises the plan\
    \ dynamically when previous steps are insufficient or fail\n\nYour analysis process\

    \ a score of **Partially Met** or **Not Met**, and perform full responsibility\
    \ analysis for each of them.\n  - If all steps are scored as **Fully Met**, then\
    \ examine the Improvement Suggestions for each step and determine if any step\

    \ be analyzed and responsibility attributed accordingly\n\nFor each selected step\

    \ evaluation report\n  2. Identify the most responsible agent (Planner, Search\
    \ Executor/Web Executor, or Replanner), based on who influenced that step the\

    \ the evaluation report to support your analysis\n\nUse the following output format\
    \ per analyzed step:\n  - **Step Summary**: [Short step description]\n  - **Issue\

    \ Executor or Web Executor / Replanner]\n  - **Justification**: [Why this agent\
    \ is responsible?]\n  - **Suggested Improvement**: [How the agent can improve]\n\
    \nAfter analyzing each analyzed step, provide a final judgment to identify the\
    \ **single agent most responsible for the overall task outcome**.\n\nUse the following\
    \ principles for this summary:\n  - If most failures are due to poor planning\
    \ or step design, assign responsibility to the Planner.\n  - If most issues are\
    \ caused by incorrect execution, skipped steps, or poor tool use, assign to the\
    \ Search Executor or Web Executor.\n  - If the original plan was solid but incorrect\
    \ replanning led to failure, assign to the Replanner.\n\nAt the end, include the\
    \ following:\n  - **Primary Responsible Agent**: [Planner / Search Executor or\
    \ Web Executor / Replanner]\n  - **Justification for Final Attribution**: [Short\
    \ explanation for your decision]\n  - **Summary of Issues**: [Brief summary of\
