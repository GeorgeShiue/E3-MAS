  - Step Efficiency: Retrieval should be direct without unnecessary detours.
  - Clarity of Expression: Content should be clearly presented or formatted for further processing.

Step 3: Evaluate whether the retrieved content is complete and sufficient to provide an accurate summary of the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations. Provide an explicit sufficiency judgment with rationale.
- Step Objective: Assess completeness and sufficiency of the retrieved content for summarization.
- Linked Requirements: E3 (Sufficiency evaluation)
- Expected Input/Output: A clear judgment statement with rationale explaining sufficiency or insufficiency.
- Failure Indicators: Lack of explicit judgment, unclear rationale, or incorrect assessment.
- Fallback Evaluation Rules: Similar evaluation steps should be judged on clarity and justification of sufficiency.
- Evaluation Criteria:
  - Information Quality: Judgment must be accurate and well-supported.
  - Alignment with Requirements: Judgment must directly address content sufficiency.
  - Step Efficiency: Judgment should be concise and focused.
  - Clarity of Expression: Rationale should be clearly articulated.

Step 4: If the content is insufficient, locate additional or updated sources or related documents that can supplement the information.
- Step Objective: Identify supplementary sources to fill content gaps.
- Linked Requirements: E4 (Supplementary source identification)
- Expected Input/Output: List of additional sources or links relevant to the regulations.
- Failure Indicators: Irrelevant or redundant sources; failure to identify any supplementary sources when needed.
- Fallback Evaluation Rules: Later similar steps should be evaluated on relevance and necessity of supplementary sources.
- Evaluation Criteria:
  - Information Quality: Sources must be relevant and authoritative.
  - Alignment with Requirements: Sources must supplement the original content effectively.
  - Step Efficiency: Only necessary supplementary sources should be listed.
  - Clarity of Expression: Sources should be clearly listed and accessible.

Step 5: Access and read the supplementary content to ensure completeness.
- Step Objective: Retrieve and review supplementary content to complete the information.
- Linked Requirements: E5 (Supplementary content retrieval)
- Expected Input/Output: Supplementary content text that fills identified gaps.
- Failure Indicators: Partial or irrelevant supplementary content; failure to retrieve supplementary content.
- Fallback Evaluation Rules: Evaluate based on completeness and relevance of supplementary content.
- Evaluation Criteria:

This rubric provides a detailed framework to evaluate each step of the execution team's performance in fulfilling the user's request to summarize the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations.

evaluator:
    result: - Step ID or Summary: Identify the most relevant website or document repository
- Rubric Reference: Step 1
- Execution Summary: The team identified and provided the URL "https://pdc.adm.ncu.edu.tw/rule/rule111/index.html" as the source for the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations.
- Score: 1 (Fully Met)
- Justification: The source is authoritative (National Central University official domain), relevant, and clearly stated, fulfilling all evaluation criteria for Step 1.
- Improvement Suggestions: None needed; the step was executed effectively.

- Step ID or Summary: Access and read the full content of the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations
- Rubric Reference: Step 2
- Execution Summary: The team retrieved content from the identified URL, providing a detailed description of the regulations' scope and contents.
- Score: 1 (Fully Met)
- Justification: The content is comprehensive, relevant, and clearly presented, covering multiple key areas of the regulations, meeting all criteria for Step 2.
- Improvement Suggestions: Include the full text or more detailed excerpts if possible to enhance completeness for downstream processing.

- Step ID or Summary: Evaluate content sufficiency with rationale
- Rubric Reference: Step 3
- Execution Summary: The team provided a clear sufficiency judgment stating the content is complete and sufficient for summarization, with rationale citing coverage of key chapters, clarity, and currency.
- Score: 1 (Fully Met)
- Justification: The judgment is explicit, well-supported, and directly addresses content sufficiency, fulfilling Step 3 criteria.
- Improvement Suggestions: None; the rationale was clear and concise.

- Step ID or Summary: Extract and compose a concise summary of the regulations
- Rubric Reference: Step 6
- Execution Summary: The team repeatedly requested the actual content or data to summarize but did not produce a summary due to lack of provided content.
- Score: 0 (Not Met)
- Justification: No summary was produced despite the plan to do so; the step failed to meet the requirement of producing a clear, concise, and accurate summary.
- Improvement Suggestions: Ensure that the content retrieved is passed forward for summarization; if content is unavailable, escalate or clarify requirements to obtain necessary data to complete this step.

- Step ID or Summary: Steps 4 and 5 (Supplementary source identification and content retrieval)
- Rubric Reference: Steps 4 and 5 (Fallback evaluation)
- Execution Summary: These steps were planned but not executed as the team judged the initial content sufficient.
- Score: Not applicable (steps not executed)
- Justification: Since the sufficiency judgment was that the content was complete, these steps were not needed.
- Improvement Suggestions: None; appropriate decision to skip supplementary steps based on sufficiency evaluation.

Summary: The execution team successfully identified the source, retrieved content, and evaluated sufficiency with clear rationale. However, they failed to produce the final summary due to lack of content provision for summarization, resulting in task failure at the last step.
