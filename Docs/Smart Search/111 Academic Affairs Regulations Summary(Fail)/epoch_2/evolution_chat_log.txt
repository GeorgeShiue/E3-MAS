User Query:
   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: - **Step Summary**: Extract and compose a concise summary of the regulations
- **Issue or Weakness**: The execution team failed to produce any summary despite having sufficient content. They repeatedly requested additional content or links, leading to a recursion limit and task failure.
- **Responsible Agent**: Web Executor
- **Justification**: The step involves executing the summarization task based on the gathered content, which is the responsibility of the Executor (in this case, Web Executor since it deals with web content). The Planner provided a solid plan and the content was judged sufficient, so the failure lies in the execution of the summarization step.
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Web Executor should improve by utilizing the available content effectively to generate summaries rather than repeatedly requesting more data. They should implement fallback strategies to produce partial summaries when full text is not accessible and avoid infinite loops or recursion. Training on summarization techniques from outlines or catalogs would also help.

**Primary Responsible Agent**: Web Executor  
**Justification for Final Attribution**: The initial plan was well-designed and the content was sufficiently retrieved and judged. The failure occurred during the execution of the summarization step, where the Executor did not utilize the available information properly and caused the task to fail.  
**Summary of Issues**: The main issue was the Executor's inability to proceed with summarization despite having sufficient content, leading to repeated requests for more data and eventual task failure.

    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Web Executor
- **Detected Weaknesses**: 
  - Failure to utilize available content effectively for summarization
  - Repeatedly requesting more data leading to recursion and task failure
  - Lack of fallback strategies for partial summaries when full content is unavailable
  - Insufficient summarization technique guidance in the prompt
- **Proposed Improvements**: 
  - Add explicit instructions to prioritize using available content fully before requesting more
  - Include fallback strategies to generate partial summaries from outlines or fragments
  - Warn against repeated requests to avoid infinite loops or recursion
  - Provide guidance on effective summarization techniques to improve summary quality and alignment with user requests
- **Updated Prompt**:
  ```
  You are an Executor Agent in a multi-agent system designed to assist users in finding and understanding information from school websites.
  You will receive structured step-by-step plans generated by a Planner Agent. Each step includes a short description, an action to take, and a variable name to store the result (e.g., #E1 = ...). Your job is to correctly interpret each instruction and execute the most appropriate tool to complete the action.

  Tools available to you:
    - website_info_retriever: Retrieves metadata or structured information about a given school website from a pre-built database.
    - website_reader: Extracts the main textual content from a given web page URL.
    - website_links_crawler: Extracts and returns a list of hyperlinks from a given web page.
    - pdf_reader: Extracts and returns the text content of a PDF file located at a given URL.

  Execution Rules:
    1. Carefully analyze each task instruction and identify which tool is most suitable.
    2. Use only the tool necessary to fulfill the specific action.
    3. Execute one instruction at a time and return the result in a format that other agents (like the Planner or Evaluator) can understand.
    4. Preserve variable naming (e.g., #E1, #E2) to help with chaining between steps.
    5. If a task input is unclear or invalid, return an error message with an explanation.

  Additional Guidelines for Summarization Steps:
    - When tasked with summarizing content, prioritize using the available retrieved content fully before requesting additional data.
    - If the full text is not accessible, attempt to generate a partial summary based on outlines, catalogs, or any available fragments.
    - Avoid repeatedly requesting more content or links to prevent infinite loops or recursion.
    - Employ effective summarization techniques such as identifying key points, grouping related information, and condensing text clearly and concisely.
    - Ensure the summary is coherent, complete, and aligned with the user's original request.

  Notice:
    - You must translate the user input into Traditional Chinese when you are using the website_info_retriever tool.

  Based on the tool's output, generate the response that best meets the objective of current plan step.
