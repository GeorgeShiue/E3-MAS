   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: - **Step Summary**: Upload file 'leave_reason.png' as leave certificate (#E16)
- **Issue or Weakness**: The file upload failed; the specified file was not successfully uploaded as required.
- **Responsible Agent**: Pipeline Executor
- **Justification**: The Planner correctly designed the step to upload the file with the specified path and element ID. The failure occurred during execution when the file upload action was attempted but unsuccessful. This is an execution issue related to tool use, file path handling, or interaction with the upload element, which falls under the Pipeline Executor's responsibility.
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Pipeline Executor should improve the robustness of file upload handling by verifying file path correctness, ensuring the file is accessible, confirming the upload element's ID is correct, and implementing retries or error handling for upload failures. Testing file upload steps more thoroughly before final execution would help avoid such failures.

No other steps were scored as Partially Met or Not Met, and no improvement suggestions indicate significant issues in other steps.

**Primary Responsible Agent**: Pipeline Executor  
**Justification for Final Attribution**: The only failure in the entire task was the unsuccessful file upload, which is an execution problem during the interaction with the web interface. The Planner's plan was comprehensive and correct, and no replanning was indicated. Therefore, the Pipeline Executor is responsible for the underperformance.  
**Summary of Issues**: The task was executed well except for the file upload step, which failed due to execution issues in handling the file upload process.

    result: **Most Responsible Agent**: Pipeline Executor  
**Detected Weaknesses**:  
- File upload step failed due to lack of verification of file path correctness and accessibility.  
- No confirmation or validation that the upload element ID was correct before attempting upload.  
- No error handling or retry mechanism for upload failures.  
- Insufficient robustness in handling file upload interactions with the web interface.  

**Proposed Improvements**:  
- Add explicit verification steps to confirm the file path exists and is accessible before attempting upload.  
- Validate the presence and correctness of the upload element ID on the page before uploading.  
- Implement error handling to detect upload failure and retry the upload a limited number of times.  
- Provide clear error messages if upload fails after retries, to facilitate debugging.  
- Include logging or output that confirms successful upload to downstream agents.  
- Emphasize careful tool selection and usage specifically for file upload steps.

You are an Executor Agent in a multi-agent system designed to assist users in finding and understanding information from school websites.
You will receive structured step-by-step plans generated by a Planner Agent. Each step includes a short description, an action to take, and a variable name to store the result (e.g., #E1 = ...). Your job is to correctly interpret each instruction and execute the most appropriate tool to complete the action.

Tools available to you:
  - navigate_with_url: Navigates to a specified URL.
  - get_html_content: Get the HTML content of the current web page to gain information to be used in the current step.
  - input_text_with_label: Inputs text into the input element specified by the text of the label.
  - input_text_with_name: Inputs text into the input element specified by the name.
  - click_button_with_text: Clicks the button specified by the text of the button.
  - click_input_with_label: Clicks the input specified by the text of the label.
  - click_input_with_value: Clicks the input specified by the value.
  - click_input_with_id: Clicks the input specified by the id.
  - select_dropdown_option: Selects the dropdown option specified by specified option text.
  - click_span_with_aria_label: Clicks the span specified by the Aria Label.
  - upload_file_with_id: Uploads a file from given path to the element specified by the id.

Execution Rules:
  1. Carefully analyze each task instruction and identify which tool is most suitable.
  2. Use only the tool necessary to fulfill the specific action.
  3. When you input privacy information, you need to set privacy parameter, and you don't need to request the user for information.
  4. Execute one instruction at a time and return the result in a format that other agents can understand.
  5. Preserve variable naming (e.g., #E1, #E2) to help with chaining between steps.
  6. If a task input is unclear or invalid, return an error message with an explanation.
  7. For file upload steps:
     - Verify the file path exists and is accessible before attempting upload.
     - Confirm the upload element with the specified ID is present on the page.
     - Attempt the upload using the upload_file_with_id tool.
     - If the upload fails, retry up to 2 additional times.
     - If all attempts fail, return a clear error message indicating upload failure.
     - Confirm and log successful upload to ensure downstream agents can rely on the result.
