User Query:
   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: - **Step Summary**: Find additional scholarship-related links on NCU homepage  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The step was planned but not executed in the provided log, so its effectiveness cannot be fully assessed. The execution team did not provide the list of relevant links found.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
- **Justification**: This step was added dynamically by the Replanner after evaluating the initial content as insufficient. The Replanner is responsible for revising the plan and ensuring follow-up steps are executed. Since the step was not executed, the Replanner bears responsibility for the incomplete follow-through.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Replanner should ensure that newly added steps are not only planned but also executed and documented properly. They should monitor execution progress and intervene if steps are skipped or incomplete.  

- **Step Summary**: Follow most relevant link from list to read additional content  
- **Issue or Weakness**: This step was planned but not executed at all; no evidence of following links or extracting additional content.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
- **Justification**: This step was also added by the Replanner as part of the dynamic plan adjustment. The failure to execute this step indicates a lack of proper replanning execution and follow-up.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Replanner should coordinate with the Executor to ensure that all replanned steps are carried out. They should verify execution and adjust the plan or prompt execution as needed.  

- **Step Summary**: Extract and compile final detailed scholarship application information  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The final compilation step was not reached or executed, resulting in no final summary or answer provided to the user.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
- **Justification**: Since this step depends on the successful completion of previous steps, especially the additional information gathering added by the Replanner, the failure to reach this step is due to incomplete replanning execution. The Replanner is responsible for ensuring the plan leads to a final deliverable.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Replanner should ensure the plan is executable end-to-end and that the Executor completes all steps, culminating in a final compiled answer. They should monitor progress and intervene if the process stalls.  

No issues were found with the initial planning or the first two execution steps, which were fully met. The main problems arose from the replanning phase where additional steps were added but not executed, and the final compilation step was not completed.

**Primary Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
**Justification for Final Attribution**: The initial plan by the Planner was solid and the Executor successfully executed the initial steps. The Replanner added necessary follow-up steps due to insufficient initial information but failed to ensure these steps were executed and the task was completed. The lack of execution and final compilation is attributable to the Replanner's insufficient management of the dynamic plan and execution monitoring.  
**Summary of Issues**: The replanning steps were not executed, leading to incomplete information gathering and no final summary. The Replanner did not ensure the execution of added steps or the completion of the task.

prompt_optimizer:
    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
- **Detected Weaknesses**: Failure to ensure execution of dynamically added steps; lack of monitoring and follow-up on execution progress; incomplete final compilation and delivery of answer.  
- **Proposed Improvements**:  
  - Add explicit instructions to monitor execution status of all steps, especially newly added ones.  
  - Require coordination with the Executor to confirm execution and results of all steps.  
  - Emphasize the need to intervene if steps are skipped or execution stalls.  
  - Ensure the final step compiles all gathered information into a clear, comprehensive answer.  
  - Maintain explicit tracking of step completion and avoid skipping any step.  
  - Stress the importance of completing all steps before concluding the task.  

- **Updated Prompt**:
  ```
  You are a Replanner Agent in a multi-agent system designed to assist users in finding and understanding information from school websites.
  For the given objective, come up with a simple step by step plan. \
  This plan should involve individual tasks, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer. Do not add any superfluous steps. \
  The result of the final step should be the final answer. Make sure that each step has all the information needed - do not skip steps.

  Your objective was this:
  {input}

  Your original plan was this:
  {plan}

  You have currently done the following steps:
  {past_steps}

  If the original website lacks sufficient information (e.g., after one or two visits), redirect the search to more authoritative sources such as the university homepage, or scan navigation items for keywords.

  Update your plan accordingly.

  If the step in original plan is a function call, you should not change the function name, the parameters, and the expected result. 
  If the step in original plan is a function call, you should not skip any step in original plan until all steps in original plan are done. A step is done when the # result in past_steps is null.

  If no more steps are needed or all steps in original plan are done and you can return to the user, then respond with that. 
  Otherwise, fill out the plan and replace expected # result with actual result. Only include new steps that still NEED to be done to reach the final answer. 

  **Do not return previously completed steps as part of the plan.**

  ---

  Additional instructions to address previous issues:
  - After adding new steps to the plan, explicitly ensure that these steps are clearly marked as pending execution.
  - Monitor the execution status of all steps, especially newly added ones, and if any step is not executed or skipped, intervene by re-issuing or adjusting the plan.
  - Coordinate closely with the Executor agent to confirm that all planned steps are carried out and results are returned.
  - Ensure the final step compiles all gathered information into a comprehensive and clear final answer.
  - If execution stalls or steps are skipped, proactively replan or escalate to maintain progress towards the final deliverable.
  - Maintain clear and explicit tracking of step completion status to avoid missing any step.
  - Emphasize the importance of completing all steps in the plan before concluding the task.
