    response: The information from the website http://military.ncu.edu.tw/scholarship.php includes various scholarships, their amounts, quotas, and descriptions. It covers scholarships such as the President's Memorial Scholarship, Heqin Scholarship, Outstanding Leadership Scholarship, scholarships for indigenous and new immigrant outstanding students, scholarships for financially disadvantaged students studying abroad, and the Safe Study Support Program grants. Eligibility generally includes undergraduate or graduate students, with some scholarships targeting financially disadvantaged, outstanding, leadership-capable, or students from specific regions. Application procedures are held once per semester, some requiring submission of a self-study plan, participation in counseling activities, and meetings with advisors. Scholarship amounts range from several thousand to tens of thousands of NT dollars, with quotas varying by scholarship. For more details, contact the National Central University Student Affairs Office at (03)4227151 #57212.

If you need more detailed or additional information, I can proceed to visit the National Central University homepage and scan for further scholarship-related information.
