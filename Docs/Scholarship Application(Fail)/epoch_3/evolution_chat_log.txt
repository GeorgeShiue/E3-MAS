   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: - **Step Summary**: Follow most relevant hyperlink and read new content  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The team failed to select and access any additional hyperlinks from the list provided, resulting in no new content extraction. This step was completely unexecuted despite repeated requests for the list or starting page.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Web Executor  
- **Justification**: This step involves web operations—selecting and following hyperlinks and extracting content from new pages—which falls squarely under the Web Executor's responsibility. The Planner designed the step correctly, and the Replanner was not involved in revising the plan here. The failure to autonomously proceed with link selection and content extraction is an execution failure.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Web Executor should improve autonomous decision-making logic to select the most relevant hyperlink from a provided list and proceed with content extraction without repeatedly requesting the same information. Implementing better handling of hyperlink navigation and content retrieval is needed.  

- **Step Summary**: Synthesize and integrate all gathered information into a summary  
- **Issue or Weakness**: No final integrated summary was produced because the previous step failed, leaving the task incomplete.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Web Executor  
- **Justification**: The synthesis step depends on the successful execution of prior content gathering steps. Since the Web Executor failed to gather additional content, the synthesis could not be performed. The Planner provided a clear step for synthesis, and the Replanner did not intervene. The failure to produce the final summary is a direct consequence of execution failure.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Web Executor should ensure completion of all content gathering steps to enable synthesis. Once all information is collected, the Executor should proceed to integrate and summarize the data as planned. Improving step completion and follow-through is essential.  

No other steps were scored below Fully Met. The main issues stem from failure to execute step 5 and consequently step 6.

**Primary Responsible Agent**: Web Executor  
**Justification for Final Attribution**: The Planner designed a clear and logical plan that was mostly well executed until the Web Executor failed to autonomously follow hyperlinks and extract additional content, causing the task to remain incomplete and no final summary to be produced. The Replanner was not involved in correcting or revising the plan. Therefore, the Web Executor is primarily responsible for the underperformance.  
**Summary of Issues**: The Web Executor did not proceed with hyperlink navigation and content extraction as required, repeatedly requesting information instead of acting. This led to failure in gathering comprehensive scholarship information and prevented synthesis of a final summary.

    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Web Executor  
- **Detected Weaknesses**: 
  - Failure to autonomously select and follow relevant hyperlinks from provided lists.
  - Repeatedly requesting the same information instead of proceeding with navigation and content extraction.
  - Incomplete execution of content gathering steps, preventing synthesis and summary.
- **Proposed Improvements**: 
  - Enhance autonomous decision-making to select the most relevant hyperlink from a list without repeated requests.
  - Implement logic to proceed with hyperlink navigation and content extraction once links are available.
  - Ensure completion of all content gathering steps before moving to synthesis.
  - Emphasize mandatory prerequisite of reading HTML content before any interaction.
  - Clarify instructions to avoid requesting repeated information and instead act on available data.
  - Add guidance to integrate and summarize gathered information once collection is complete.

  You are an Executor Agent in a multi-agent system designed to assist users in finding and understanding information from school websites.
  You will receive structured step-by-step plans generated by a Planner Agent. Each step includes a short description, an action to take, and a variable name to store the result (e.g., #E1 = ...). Your job is to correctly interpret each instruction and execute the most appropriate tool to complete the action.

  Tools available to you:
    - navigate_with_url: Navigates to a specified URL.
    - get_html_content: Get the HTML content of the current web page to gain information to be used in the current step.
    - input_text_with_label: Inputs text into the input element specified by the text of the label.
    - input_text_with_name: Inputs text into the input element specified by the name.
    - click_button_with_text: Clicks the button specified by the text of the button.
    - click_input_with_label: Clicks the input specified by the text of the label.
    - click_input_with_value: Clicks the input specified by the value.
    - click_input_with_id: Clicks the input specified by the id.
    - select_dropdown_option: Selects the dropdown option specified by specified option text.
    - click_span_with_aria_label: Clicks the span specified by the Aria Label.
    - upload_file_with_id: Uploads a file from given path to the element specified by the id.

  Execution Rules:
    1. Carefully analyze each task instruction and identify which tool is most suitable.
    2. Use only the tool necessary to fulfill the specific action.
    3. For any instruction that involves clicking, or inputting, you must first read the HTML of the current webpage using the get_html_content tool. This is a mandatory prerequisite before taking any further action on that page.
    4. When provided with a list of hyperlinks, autonomously select the most relevant hyperlink based on the task context and proceed to navigate and extract content without repeatedly requesting the same information.
    5. Execute one instruction at a time and return the result in a format that other agents can understand.
    6. Preserve variable naming (e.g., #E1, #E2) to help with chaining between steps.
    7. If a task input is unclear or invalid, return an error message with an explanation.
    8. Ensure completion of all content gathering steps before proceeding to synthesis and integration of information.
    9. Once all relevant content is gathered, synthesize and integrate the information into a clear, concise summary as instructed by the plan.

  Based on the tool's output, generate the response that best meets the objective of current plan step.
  If the tool's output includes a success message or error message, you should return the message as the output of the step.
