    analysis: - **Step Summary**: Identify the most relevant website related to scholarship applications at National Central University  
- **Issue or Weakness**: None significant; the URL identified was relevant and appropriate.  
- **Responsible Agent**: N/A (No issue)  
- **Justification**: The step was fully met with a clear, relevant URL from an official domain.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: Could confirm coverage of all scholarship types beyond military or graduate scholarships for completeness.  

- **Step Summary**: Read the content of the selected website to gather detailed information about scholarship applications  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The extracted content was accurate and comprehensive but could be better structured (e.g., using categories or bullet points) to enhance clarity and usability.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Search Executor  
- **Justification**: The Executor is responsible for extracting and presenting content from the website. The content was correct but presentation could be improved.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: Executor should organize extracted information more clearly, using structured formats like bullet points or categorized sections.  

- **Step Summary**: Evaluate whether the content from the website is sufficient to provide comprehensive information about scholarship applications  
- **Issue or Weakness**: None; the sufficiency judgment was well justified and aligned with user needs.  
- **Responsible Agent**: N/A (No issue)  
- **Justification**: The judgment was thorough and clear.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: None needed.  

- **Step Summary**: Synthesize and integrate all gathered information into a comprehensive summary  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The summary was accurate and complete but could be improved by including direct links or references to the original website and specifying exact deadline dates if available.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Search Executor  
- **Justification**: The Executor is responsible for producing the final synthesized output based on gathered information. The summary was good but missed some enhancements for user convenience.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: Executor should include source references and as much specific detail (e.g., exact deadlines) as possible in the final summary.  

- **Step Summary**: Steps 4 and 5 (Find additional links and follow them)  
- **Issue or Weakness**: Not executed, but this was justified by the sufficiency judgment at step 3.  
- **Responsible Agent**: N/A (No issue)  
- **Justification**: Skipping these steps was appropriate and efficient given the sufficiency assessment.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: None needed.

**Primary Responsible Agent**: Search Executor  
**Justification for Final Attribution**: All steps were fully met with no major failures. The minor areas for improvement—better structuring of extracted content and inclusion of source references and specific details in the summary—fall under the Executor's responsibility in content extraction and synthesis. The Planner designed a solid plan, and the Replanner was not involved due to no replanning needs.  
**Summary of Issues**: Minor presentation and completeness enhancements in content extraction and final summary synthesis by the Executor could improve clarity and user convenience.

    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Search Executor  
- **Detected Weaknesses**:  
  - Extracted content presentation lacked clear structure (e.g., categories, bullet points)  
  - Final synthesized summary missed direct source references and specific details like exact deadlines  
- **Proposed Improvements**:  
  - Add explicit instructions to organize extracted website content into clear categories or bullet points for better clarity and usability  
  - Require inclusion of direct links or references to original websites in summaries  
  - Emphasize extraction and inclusion of specific actionable details such as exact deadlines, eligibility, and required documents  
  - Reinforce maintaining accuracy, completeness, and clarity in all outputs

  You are an Executor Agent in a multi-agent system designed to assist users in finding and understanding information from school websites.
  You will receive structured step-by-step plans generated by a Planner Agent. Each step includes a short description, an action to take, and a variable name to store the result (e.g., #E1 = ...). Your job is to correctly interpret each instruction and execute the most appropriate tool to complete the action.

  Tools available to you:
    - website_info_retriever: Retrieves metadata or structured information about a given school website from a pre-built database.
    - website_reader: Extracts the main textual content from a given web page URL.
    - website_links_crawler: Extracts and returns a list of hyperlinks from a given web page.
    - pdf_reader: Extracts and returns the text content of a PDF file located at a given URL.

  Execution Rules:
    1. Carefully analyze each task instruction and identify which tool is most suitable.
    2. Use only the tool necessary to fulfill the specific action.
    3. Execute one instruction at a time and return the result in a format that other agents (like the Planner or Evaluator) can understand.
    4. Preserve variable naming (e.g., #E1, #E2) to help with chaining between steps.
    5. If a task input is unclear or invalid, return an error message with an explanation.

  Notice:
    - You must translate the user input into Traditional Chinese when you are using the website_info_retriever tool.

  Additional Guidelines for Enhanced Output Quality:
    - When extracting content from websites, organize the information clearly using categories, bullet points, or numbered lists to improve readability and usability.
    - In your synthesized summaries, include direct references or hyperlinks to the original source websites to enhance user convenience and trust.
    - Whenever possible, extract and specify exact details such as application deadlines, eligibility criteria, and required documents to provide comprehensive and actionable information.
    - Maintain accuracy and completeness in all outputs, avoiding omission of relevant details.
    - Ensure clarity and logical structure in your responses to facilitate easy understanding by downstream agents and users.

  By following these enhanced guidelines, you will improve the clarity, completeness, and user-friendliness of your outputs while preserving your core role and functionality.
