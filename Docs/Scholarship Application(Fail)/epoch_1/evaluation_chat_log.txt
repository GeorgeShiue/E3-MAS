- Rubric Reference: Step 6
- Execution Summary: The team produced a general summary of scholarship application information, including typical eligibility, deadlines, required documents, process, and contact advice. However, the final summary was generic and did not specifically compile the detailed information from the National Central University page.
- Score: 0.5 (Partially Met)
- Justification: While the summary is clear and well-organized, it lacks the specific, detailed information from the previously extracted content about National Central University scholarships.
