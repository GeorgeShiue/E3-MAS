rubric: Here is the structured evaluation rubric for the multi-step plan to find the headmaster of National Central University in Taiwan:

### Step 1: Search the internal website database
1. **Step Objective**: Identify the most relevant website that likely contains information about the headmaster.
2. **Linked Requirements**: Requirement to find authoritative and relevant sources of information.
3. **Expected Input/Output**: Input: User query; Output: URL of the most relevant website.
4. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - Accuracy of the selected URL (does it lead to a relevant source?)
   - Completeness of the search (are all potential sources considered?)
   - Tool appropriateness (is the internal database the right tool for this task?)
5. **Failure Indicators**: 
   - The URL does not lead to a relevant page.
   - No URL is returned.
   - The search does not consider multiple potential sources.
6. **Preference Alignment**: Supports the preference for using authoritative sources.
7. **Fallback Evaluation Rules**: If a similar search step is introduced later, evaluate based on the relevance and authority of the new source.

### Step 3: Evaluate content sufficiency
1. **Step Objective**: Assess whether the information gathered is sufficient to identify the headmaster.
2. **Linked Requirements**: Requirement to confirm the adequacy of information.
3. **Expected Input/Output**: Input: Content from Step 2; Output: Assessment of sufficiency.
4. **Evaluation Criteria**:

5. **Failure Indicators**: 
   - The assessment incorrectly states the information is sufficient when it is not.
   - The evaluation lacks depth or fails to consider key details.
6. **Preference Alignment**: Supports the preference for thorough evaluation before proceeding.
7. **Fallback Evaluation Rules**: If a similar evaluation step is introduced later, ensure it maintains the same rigor in assessing sufficiency.

### Step 4: Identify relevant in-page links
1. **Step Objective**: Find additional links that may lead to more information about the headmaster.
2. **Linked Requirements**: Requirement to explore further sources if initial information is insufficient.
3. **Expected Input/Output**: Input: Content from Step 2; Output: List of relevant hyperlinks.
