result: - Step ID or Summary: Identification of the most relevant National Central University scholarship webpage
- Rubric Reference: Step 1
- Execution Summary: The execution team initially identified the URL https://cis.ncu.edu.tw/Scholarship/# as the most relevant page for scholarship applications at National Central University. This page was described as containing detailed scholarship information and application methods.
- Score: Fully Met
- Justification: The URL provided is valid, directly relevant to scholarship applications, and clearly stated. It aligns well with the user's request and the rubric's criteria for information quality, relevance, and clarity.
- Improvement Suggestions: None significant; the step was executed well. Future improvements could include briefly confirming the page's accessibility and currency at this stage.

- Step ID or Summary: Access and read content of identified webpage
- Rubric Reference: Step 2
- Execution Summary: The team accessed the identified page and summarized that it contained multiple scholarship types, application start and end dates, eligibility criteria, and application methods including downloadable forms and some online links. However, it lacked a detailed list of required documents.
- Score: Partially Met
- Justification: The content gathered was relevant and informative, covering eligibility, deadlines, and application procedures, but was incomplete regarding required documents. The summary was clear and well-organized but missed a key detail.
- Improvement Suggestions: The team should have explicitly noted the missing document list and planned to supplement this gap immediately, which they did later. Including a direct quote or more detailed content excerpts could improve clarity.

- Step ID or Summary: Evaluate sufficiency of gathered content
- Rubric Reference: Step 3
- Execution Summary: The team attempted to evaluate the content but encountered a "404 page not found" error when trying to access the page for further details, preventing a full assessment.
- Score: Not Met
- Justification: The evaluation was inconclusive due to inaccessible content, and no clear judgment on sufficiency was provided. This fails the rubric's requirement for a clear, justified sufficiency assessment.
- Improvement Suggestions: The team should have verified page accessibility earlier and prepared alternative plans sooner. A clearer statement of insufficiency based on missing or inaccessible content would improve this step.

- Step ID or Summary: Identify alternative scholarship information sources on official homepage
- Rubric Reference: Step 4
- Execution Summary: The team accessed the official National Central University homepage (https://www.ncu.edu.tw/) and scanned for scholarship-related links but initially found no relevant navigation menus with expected keywords.
- Score: Partially Met
- Justification: The team correctly accessed the homepage and attempted to find relevant links but did not find any with the initial keyword set. The effort was appropriate but incomplete as no alternative keywords were tried at this step.
- Improvement Suggestions: The team could have broadened keyword searches or used site search functions earlier to improve link discovery efficiency.

- Step ID or Summary: Search homepage with alternative keywords and list relevant scholarship pages
- Rubric Reference: Step 4 (Fallback Evaluation Rules)
- Execution Summary: Using alternative keywords, the team found multiple relevant scholarship pages on the official site, including graduate scholarships, financial aid support, various scholarships overview, undergraduate admission scholarships, and the original scholarship management system page. They provided URLs and summaries for each.
- Score: Fully Met
- Justification: The team successfully identified a comprehensive list of valid, relevant, and clearly presented links that supplement missing information. This aligns well with the fallback evaluation criteria for step 4.
- Improvement Suggestions: None significant; the step was thorough and well-executed. Future improvements could include prioritizing links by relevance or completeness.

- Step ID or Summary: Final compilation and user guidance
- Rubric Reference: Step 6 (Fallback Evaluation Rules)
- Execution Summary: The team compiled and presented a summary of multiple relevant scholarship information pages with URLs and brief descriptions, offering the user a comprehensive resource list for eligibility, deadlines, application procedures, and contact information.
- Score: Fully Met
- Justification: The final output is clear, well-organized, and addresses the user's query comprehensively by providing multiple authoritative sources. It meets the rubric's criteria for completeness, clarity, and alignment with user needs.
- Improvement Suggestions: The team could enhance user experience by highlighting key differences among the pages or suggesting which link to start with based on typical user needs.
