    rubric: Evaluation Rubric for Execution Team Performance on Summarizing the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations

Step 1: Identify the most relevant website or document repository that contains the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations of National Central University.
- Step Objective: Locate the primary source or repository where the official 111 Academic Affairs Regulations can be found.

- Evaluation Criteria:
  - Information Quality: Source must be accurate and official.
  - Alignment with Requirements: Source must correspond to the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations.
  - Step Efficiency: Source identification should be direct without unnecessary detours.
  - Clarity of Expression: Source location should be clearly stated and accessible.

Step 2: Access and read the full content of the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations from the identified source.
- Step Objective: Retrieve the complete text of the regulations from the identified source.
- Linked Requirements: E2 (Content retrieval)
- Expected Input/Output: Full text content of the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations.
- Failure Indicators: Partial content, inaccessible content, or content from incorrect documents.
- Fallback Evaluation Rules: If partial content is retrieved, evaluate completeness and note gaps.
- Evaluation Criteria:
  - Information Quality: Content must be complete and accurate.
  - Alignment with Requirements: Content must match the identified regulations.
  - Step Efficiency: Retrieval should be direct and without unnecessary steps.
  - Clarity of Expression: Content should be clearly presented or formatted for further processing.

Step 3: Evaluate whether the retrieved content is complete and sufficient to provide an accurate summary of the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations. Provide an explicit sufficiency judgment with rationale.
- Step Objective: Assess the completeness and adequacy of the retrieved content for summarization.
- Linked Requirements: E3 (Sufficiency evaluation)
- Expected Input/Output: A clear judgment statement on sufficiency with supporting rationale.
- Failure Indicators: Lack of explicit judgment, unclear rationale, or incorrect sufficiency assessment.
- Fallback Evaluation Rules: If judgment is implicit, evaluate based on clarity and justification.
- Evaluation Criteria:
  - Information Quality: Judgment must be well-supported and accurate.
  - Alignment with Requirements: Judgment must address content sufficiency explicitly.
  - Step Efficiency: Judgment should be concise and focused.
  - Clarity of Expression: Rationale should be clearly articulated.

Step 4: If the content is insufficient, locate additional or updated sources or related documents that can supplement the information.
- Step Objective: Find supplementary sources to fill gaps in the initial content.
- Linked Requirements: E4 (Supplementary source identification)
- Expected Input/Output: List of additional sources or links relevant to the regulations.
- Failure Indicators: Irrelevant or redundant sources; failure to find any supplementary sources when needed.
- Fallback Evaluation Rules: If supplementary sources differ from original but are relevant, evaluate based on relevance and authority.
- Evaluation Criteria:
  - Information Quality: Sources must be credible and relevant.
  - Alignment with Requirements: Sources must supplement missing or outdated information.
  - Step Efficiency: Source search should be targeted and purposeful.
  - Clarity of Expression: Sources should be clearly listed and accessible.

Step 5: Access and read the supplementary content to ensure completeness.
- Step Objective: Retrieve and review supplementary content to confirm it fills identified gaps.
- Linked Requirements: E5 (Supplementary content retrieval)
- Expected Input/Output: Supplementary content text that complements the initial content.
- Failure Indicators: Incomplete or irrelevant supplementary content; failure to access sources.
- Fallback Evaluation Rules: Partial supplementary content should be evaluated for relevance and contribution.
- Evaluation Criteria:
  - Information Quality: Supplementary content must be accurate and relevant.
  - Alignment with Requirements: Content must address previously identified insufficiencies.
  - Step Efficiency: Retrieval should be efficient and purposeful.
  - Clarity of Expression: Content should be clearly presented.

Step 6: Extract and compose a concise summary of the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations based on the gathered content.
- Step Objective: Produce a clear, accurate, and concise summary of the regulations.
- Linked Requirements: E6 (Summary composition)
- Expected Input/Output: A well-structured summary capturing key points of the regulations.
- Failure Indicators: Summary is incomplete, inaccurate, overly verbose, or unclear.
- Fallback Evaluation Rules: If summary is partial or less concise, evaluate based on coverage and clarity.
- Evaluation Criteria:
  - Information Quality: Summary must be accurate and comprehensive.
  - Alignment with Requirements: Summary must reflect the content of the regulations.
  - Step Efficiency: Summary should be concise without losing essential information.
  - Clarity of Expression: Summary should be clearly written and easy to understand.

This rubric provides a detailed framework to evaluate each step of the execution team's performance in fulfilling the user's request to summarize the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations.

evaluator:
    result: - Step ID or Summary: Identify the most relevant website or document repository
- Rubric Reference: Step 1
- Execution Summary: The execution team identified the URL https://pdc.adm.ncu.edu.tw/rule/rule111/index.html as the source for the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations.
- Score: 1 (Fully Met)
- Justification: The source is an official university domain (ncu.edu.tw) and appears to be the authoritative repository for the regulations. The URL was clearly stated and relevant to the task, meeting all evaluation criteria for information quality, alignment, efficiency, and clarity.
- Improvement Suggestions: None needed; the step was executed well.

- Step ID or Summary: Access and read the full content of the regulations
- Rubric Reference: Step 2
- Execution Summary: The team retrieved the full content of the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations, including a comprehensive table of contents covering various academic rules and procedures.
- Score: 1 (Fully Met)
- Justification: The content retrieved was complete and relevant, matching the identified source. The retrieval was direct and the content was clearly presented as a full catalog of the regulations.
- Improvement Suggestions: None needed; the content retrieval was effective and efficient.

- Step ID or Summary: Evaluate content sufficiency with rationale
- Rubric Reference: Step 3
- Execution Summary: The team provided a sufficiency judgment stating that the retrieved catalog content was comprehensive and sufficient for summarization, with rationale explaining coverage of key academic rules.
- Score: 1 (Fully Met)
- Justification: The judgment was explicit, well-supported, and clearly articulated, addressing the completeness and adequacy of the content for summarization.
- Improvement Suggestions: None needed; the sufficiency evaluation was clear and justified.

- Step ID or Summary: Extract and compose a concise summary of the regulations
- Rubric Reference: Step 6
- Execution Summary: The execution team repeatedly requested additional content or links to proceed with the summary extraction but did not produce a summary. The task reached a recursion limit and failed.
- Score: 0 (Not Met)
- Justification: Despite having sufficient content identified and judged, the team failed to extract or compose any summary. The repeated requests for more content indicate a failure to utilize the available information effectively, resulting in task failure.
- Improvement Suggestions: The team should proceed to summarize based on the available catalog content rather than repeatedly requesting more data. They should implement fallback strategies to generate partial summaries when full text is not accessible and avoid infinite loops or recursion. Training on summarization from outlines or catalogs would improve performance.

No additional steps were executed beyond those in the original plan.
