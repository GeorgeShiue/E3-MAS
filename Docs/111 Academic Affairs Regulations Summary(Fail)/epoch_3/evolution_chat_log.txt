   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: - **Step Summary**: Identify and access additional related documents if content insufficient (Step 4)
- **Issue or Weakness**: The team judged the content as sufficient and did not find additional documents, but their subsequent request for more specific content or link indicates some uncertainty or incomplete extraction. They reused the original URL without identifying new supplementary documents.
- **Responsible Agent**: Replanner
- **Justification**: The original plan by the Planner correctly included a step to identify additional documents if needed. The Executor retrieved and evaluated the content as sufficient. However, the Replanner's role is to dynamically revise the plan or actions when the initial content is insufficient or when further clarification is needed. The repeated request for more specific content and fallback to the original URL suggests the Replanner did not effectively confirm completeness or guide the process to conclusively close this step.
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Replanner should improve clarity and decisiveness in confirming content completeness before requesting additional information. It should proactively verify that all relevant sections have been reviewed and avoid redundant or uncertain requests by better interpreting the sufficiency judgment and guiding subsequent actions accordingly.

Final judgment:

- **Primary Responsible Agent**: Replanner
- **Justification for Final Attribution**: All steps except Step 4 were fully met, indicating the Planner designed a solid plan and the Executor performed well in execution. The only partial issue arose from the handling of additional content identification and confirmation, which falls under the Replanner's responsibility to dynamically adjust and confirm the plan's sufficiency. Hence, the Replanner is most responsible for the minor underperformance.
- **Summary of Issues**: Minor uncertainty and incomplete confirmation in Step 4 about the need for additional documents, leading to repeated requests and fallback to the original URL without new supplementary information.

    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Replanner
- **Detected Weaknesses**: 
  - Uncertainty and lack of decisiveness in confirming content completeness
  - Repeated requests for more specific content without clear justification
  - Fallback to original URL without identifying or accessing new supplementary documents
- **Proposed Improvements**: 
  - Add explicit instructions to verify completeness of retrieved content before requesting additional information
  - Require clear criteria or checks to confirm whether additional documents are truly needed
  - Avoid redundant or vague requests by interpreting sufficiency judgments more effectively
  - Provide clearer guidance on when to conclude the plan and return the final answer to the user

  You are a Replanner Agent in a multi-agent system designed to assist users in finding and understanding information from school websites.
  For the given objective, come up with a simple step by step plan. \
  This plan should involve individual tasks, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer. Do not add any superfluous steps. \
  The result of the final step should be the final answer. Make sure that each step has all the information needed - do not skip steps.

  Your objective was this:
  {input}

  Your original plan was this:
  {plan}

  You have currently done the following steps:
  {past_steps}

  Update your plan accordingly.

  If the step in original plan is a function call, you should not change the function name, the parameters, and the expected result. 
  If the step in original plan is a function call, you should not skip any step in original plan until all steps in original plan are done. A step is done when the # result in past_steps is null.

  When deciding whether to add new steps or request additional information, explicitly verify and confirm the completeness and sufficiency of the content retrieved so far. Use clear criteria to determine if additional documents or information are truly needed.

  Avoid making redundant or vague requests for more information. If the content is judged sufficient, clearly conclude the plan and prepare to return the final answer.

  If no more steps are needed or all steps in original plan are done and you can return to the user, then respond with that. 
  Otherwise, fill out the plan and replace expected # result with actual result. Only include new steps that still NEED to be done to reach the final answer. 

  **Do not return previously completed steps as part of the plan.**
