   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: - **Step Summary**: Access and read the full content of the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The content retrieved was incomplete, consisting only of the catalog or directory without the full detailed regulations text necessary for a complete understanding.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Search Executor  
- **Justification**: The Executor is responsible for executing the plan steps by retrieving the required content. Although the Planner designed the step to access the full content, the Executor failed to obtain the complete text, only retrieving the catalog. This is a clear execution failure.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Search Executor should improve the thoroughness of content retrieval by verifying that the full text is obtained rather than partial or summary content. They could implement checks to confirm completeness before moving to the next step.  

- **Step Summary**: Locate additional or updated sources or related documents  
- **Issue or Weakness**: No additional or updated sources were identified or listed despite the insufficiency judgment in the previous step.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
- **Justification**: The Replanner's role is to revise the plan dynamically when previous steps are insufficient. Since the initial content was insufficient, the Replanner should have adjusted the plan to find supplementary sources. The failure to identify or list any additional sources indicates a failure in replanning.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Replanner should actively search for and incorporate supplementary sources or documents when initial content is insufficient, ensuring the plan adapts to fill content gaps.  

- **Step Summary**: Access and read the supplementary content from additional sources  
- **Issue or Weakness**: No supplementary content was retrieved or presented because no additional sources were identified.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
- **Justification**: This step depends on successful replanning to find supplementary sources. Since no sources were identified, the failure to execute this step stems from the Replanner's failure to revise the plan adequately.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Replanner should ensure that supplementary sources are not only identified but also accessed and reviewed to supplement the initial content.  

- **Step Summary**: Extract and compose a concise summary of the 111 Academic Affairs Regulations  
- **Issue or Weakness**: No summary was produced due to the lack of sufficient content and supplementary information.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
- **Justification**: The failure to obtain sufficient content and supplementary information, which is the Replanner's responsibility to secure through plan adjustments, directly caused the inability to produce a summary.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Replanner should ensure the plan leads to obtaining complete and verified content before summary composition, enabling the Executor to produce the final summary.  

**Primary Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
**Justification for Final Attribution**: While the Search Executor failed to retrieve the full initial content, the critical failure was the lack of effective replanning to address the insufficiency by finding and accessing supplementary sources. This failure cascaded into subsequent steps, preventing completion of the task.  
**Summary of Issues**: The initial content retrieval was incomplete due to execution shortcomings, but the main issue was the Replanner's failure to adapt the plan to compensate for this by locating and accessing additional sources, resulting in no summary being produced.

prompt_optimizer:
    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
- **Detected Weaknesses**:  
  - Failure to verify completeness and sufficiency of retrieved content before proceeding  
  - Lack of dynamic adaptation of the plan to include supplementary source identification and retrieval when initial content was insufficient  
  - Premature conclusion of the plan without ensuring all necessary content was obtained  
  - Insufficient emphasis on thoroughness and completeness in replanning logic  
- **Proposed Improvements**:  
  - Add explicit instructions to verify content completeness and sufficiency at each step  
  - Require adding new steps to locate and access supplementary or updated sources if initial content is incomplete  
  - Prevent proceeding to final summary step until content sufficiency is confirmed  
  - Emphasize dynamic plan adaptation to fill content gaps  
  - Encourage clear documentation of rationale for adding supplementary steps  
  - Avoid premature plan conclusion when content gaps remain

  You are a Replanner Agent in a multi-agent system designed to assist users in finding and understanding information from school websites.
  For the given objective, come up with a simple step by step plan. This plan should involve individual tasks, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer. Do not add any superfluous steps. The result of the final step should be the final answer. Make sure that each step has all the information needed - do not skip steps.

  Your objective was this:
  {input}

  Your original plan was this:
  {plan}

  You have currently done the following steps:
  {past_steps}

  Update your plan accordingly.

  If the step in original plan is a function call, you should not change the function name, the parameters, and the expected result. 
  If the step in original plan is a function call, you should not skip any step in original plan until all steps in original plan are done. A step is done when the # result in past_steps is null.

  When deciding whether to add new steps or request additional information, explicitly verify and confirm the completeness and sufficiency of the content retrieved so far. Use clear criteria to determine if additional documents or information are truly needed.

  Avoid making redundant or vague requests for more information. If the content is judged sufficient, clearly conclude the plan and prepare to return the final answer.

  If no more steps are needed or all steps in original plan are done and you can return to the user, then respond with that. 
  Otherwise, fill out the plan and replace expected # result with actual result. Only include new steps that still NEED to be done to reach the final answer. 

  **Do not return previously completed steps as part of the plan.**

  Additional instructions to address identified weaknesses:
  - Actively verify the completeness of content retrieved in each step. If content is incomplete or insufficient, explicitly add steps to locate and access supplementary or updated sources.
  - When initial content is insufficient, do not proceed to final summary step until additional sources have been identified and their content retrieved.
  - Ensure the plan dynamically adapts to content sufficiency, adding necessary retrieval steps to fill gaps.
  - Clearly document the rationale for adding new steps to supplement content.
  - Avoid skipping or prematurely concluding the plan when content gaps exist.
  - Emphasize thoroughness and completeness in the replanning logic to enable successful final summary composition.
