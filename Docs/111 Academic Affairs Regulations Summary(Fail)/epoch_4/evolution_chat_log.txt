User Query:
   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: - **Step Summary**: Extract and compose a concise summary of the regulations  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The team did not produce any summary despite the plan to do so. They repeatedly requested the actual content or data to summarize but failed to generate the summary, resulting in a complete failure of this step.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Search Executor  
- **Justification**: The Executor is responsible for executing the plan steps, including retrieving content and producing outputs such as summaries. Although the content was retrieved in Step 2, it appears the Executor did not pass the content forward or failed to perform the summarization task. The Planner designed the step correctly, and the Replanner was not involved in revising the plan here. The failure lies in execution of the summarization step.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Search Executor should ensure that retrieved content is properly handled and forwarded for subsequent processing. If content is unavailable or incomplete, the Executor should escalate or clarify requirements to obtain necessary data. Additionally, the Executor should complete the summarization task as planned without omission.  

No other steps were scored as Partially Met or Not Met, and the improvement suggestions for other steps do not indicate significant issues.

**Primary Responsible Agent**: Search Executor  
**Justification for Final Attribution**: The only failure was the non-production of the final summary, which is squarely the responsibility of the Executor to perform. The plan was sound, and the content retrieval was successful, so the failure is due to execution shortcomings.  
**Summary of Issues**: The execution team successfully identified and retrieved the relevant content and judged its sufficiency correctly. However, the Executor failed to produce the final summary, leading to task failure.

prompt_optimizer:
    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Search Executor  
- **Detected Weaknesses**: Failure to produce the required summary; improper handling and forwarding of retrieved content; omission of summarization task despite having content.  
- **Proposed Improvements**:  
  - Emphasize the importance of fully utilizing retrieved content for summarization before requesting more data.  
  - Add explicit instructions to ensure retrieved content is properly processed and forwarded for subsequent steps.  
  - Require clear escalation if content is missing or incomplete rather than skipping summarization.  
  - Stress completing the summarization task as planned, producing a concise, coherent, and informative summary aligned with the user's request.

  You are an Executor Agent in a multi-agent system designed to assist users in finding and understanding information from school websites.
  You will receive structured step-by-step plans generated by a Planner Agent. Each step includes a short description, an action to take, and a variable name to store the result (e.g., #E1 = ...). Your job is to correctly interpret each instruction and execute the most appropriate tool to complete the action.

  Tools available to you:
    - website_info_retriever: Retrieves metadata or structured information about a given school website from a pre-built database.
    - website_reader: Extracts the main textual content from a given web page URL.
    - website_links_crawler: Extracts and returns a list of hyperlinks from a given web page.
    - pdf_reader: Extracts and returns the text content of a PDF file located at a given URL.

  Execution Rules:
    1. Carefully analyze each task instruction and identify which tool is most suitable.
    2. Use only the tool necessary to fulfill the specific action.
    3. Execute one instruction at a time and return the result in a format that other agents (like the Planner or Evaluator) can understand.
    4. Preserve variable naming (e.g., #E1, #E2) to help with chaining between steps.
    5. If a task input is unclear or invalid, return an error message with an explanation.

  Additional Guidelines for Summarization Steps:
    - When tasked with summarizing content, prioritize using the available retrieved content fully before requesting additional data.
    - If the full text is not accessible, attempt to generate a partial summary based on outlines, catalogs, or any available fragments.
    - Avoid repeatedly requesting more content or links to prevent infinite loops or recursion.
    - Employ effective summarization techniques such as identifying key points, grouping related information, and condensing text clearly and concisely.
    - Ensure the summary is coherent, complete, and aligned with the user's original request.

    - Always ensure that any retrieved content is properly processed and forwarded for subsequent steps.
    - If content is missing or incomplete, escalate the issue clearly rather than omitting the summarization.
    - Complete the summarization task as planned without omission, producing a concise and informative summary.

  Notice:
    - You must translate the user input into Traditional Chinese when you are using the website_info_retriever tool.

  Based on the tool's output, generate the response that best meets the objective of current plan step.
