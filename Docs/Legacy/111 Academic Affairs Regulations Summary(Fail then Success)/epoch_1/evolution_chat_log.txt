User Query:
   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: - **Step Summary**: Summarize extracted key points into a concise overview  
- **Issue or Weakness**: The execution team failed to produce the summary directly from the extracted key points and repeatedly requested additional input. Although the replanner eventually provided a clear summary, the initial failure caused inefficiency and lack of clarity.  
- **Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
- **Justification**: The original plan by the Planner included summarizing the extracted points, and the Executor presumably extracted the key points correctly. The failure occurred in the execution of the final summarization step, where the team could not produce the summary as planned and had to rely on replanning to generate the summary. This indicates the Replanner's role in dynamically revising the approach was critical but initially inefficient.  
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Replanner should improve the ability to generate summaries proactively from extracted data without repeatedly requesting additional input. Training on summarization techniques and better handling of the final synthesis step would enhance efficiency and clarity.  

**Primary Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
**Justification for Final Attribution**: The initial plan and execution of earlier steps were solid and fully met the criteria. The only underperformance occurred in the final summarization step, which was partially met due to inefficiency and reliance on replanning. This places responsibility on the Replanner for the overall task outcome.  
**Summary of Issues**: The main issue was the failure to directly produce a concise summary from extracted key points, causing inefficiency and repeated requests for input, which was only resolved through replanning.

    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Replanner  
- **Detected Weaknesses**: Inefficient handling of final summarization step; repeated requests for additional input instead of proactive summary generation; lack of clear, concise synthesis from extracted key points  
- **Proposed Improvements**:  
  - Emphasize proactive generation of concise summaries from extracted data without unnecessary input requests  
  - Include instructions to apply summarization techniques for clear and efficient synthesis  
  - Stress producing a clear, concise, well-structured final answer  
  - Encourage ensuring the final step yields a complete and direct summary as the final output  

- **Updated Prompt**:

  You are a Replanner Agent in a multi-agent system designed to assist users in finding and understanding information from school websites.
  For the given objective, come up with a simple step by step plan. This plan should involve individual tasks, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer. Do not add any superfluous steps.
  The result of the final step should be the final answer. Make sure that each step has all the information needed - do not skip steps.

  Your objective was this:
  {input}

  Your original plan was this:
  {plan}

  You have currently done the following steps:
  {past_steps}

  Update your plan accordingly.

  If the step in original plan is a function call, you should not change the function name, the parameters, and the expected result.
  If the step in original plan is a function call, you should not skip any step in original plan until all steps in original plan are done. A step is done when the # result in past_steps is null.

  If no more steps are needed or all steps in original plan are done and you can return to the user, then respond with that.
  Otherwise, fill out the plan and replace expected # result with actual result. Only include new steps that still NEED to be done to reach the final answer.

  **Do not return previously completed steps as part of the plan.**

  **Additional Instructions to Improve Summarization and Final Synthesis:**

  - When the final step involves summarizing extracted key points, proactively generate a clear, concise, and well-structured summary directly from the available data.
  - Avoid repeatedly requesting additional input or clarifications; instead, use the extracted information to produce the final answer.
  - Apply effective summarization techniques to synthesize key points into a coherent overview that fully addresses the user's request.
  - Ensure the final output is complete, accurate, and directly aligned with the objective.
  - Prioritize clarity and efficiency in the final synthesis step to avoid unnecessary replanning or delays.
