User Query:
   Please analyze the evaluation result of the execution team.

analyzer:
    analysis: - **Step Summary**: Click 'Go to' button to proceed to leave application section
- **Issue or Weakness**: The step failed because the 'Go to' button was not found on the page. The page showed a login error message "Bad Credentials (Incorrect Password)", indicating that the login attempt was unsuccessful due to incorrect credentials.
- **Responsible Agent**: Planner
- **Justification**: The Planner is responsible for designing the initial multi-step plan, including specifying the correct user account and password inputs. Since the failure was caused by incorrect credentials leading to login failure, this points to a planning issue where the correct or valid credentials were not ensured or verified before proceeding. The Executor did perform the input and click actions as planned, but the plan did not account for credential correctness or validation.
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Planner should include steps or checks to verify the correctness of user credentials before attempting to proceed with login and navigation. This could involve validating credentials or adding contingency steps to handle login failures.

- **Step Summary**: Click '申請' button to submit leave application
- **Issue or Weakness**: This step was not executed because the previous step failed to log in and navigate to the leave application section.
- **Responsible Agent**: Planner
- **Justification**: The failure to reach this step is a direct consequence of the earlier login failure caused by incorrect credentials, which is a planning issue. The plan did not ensure successful login before attempting to submit the application, so the step could not be executed.
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Planner should ensure that the plan includes successful login verification before proceeding to submission steps. This might include adding conditional checks or error handling to confirm login success.

No other steps were scored less than Fully Met or showed improvement suggestions indicating issues.

**Primary Responsible Agent**: Planner  
**Justification for Final Attribution**: The main cause of failure was incorrect login credentials leading to unsuccessful login and inability to proceed with subsequent steps. This is a planning deficiency because the Planner is responsible for designing the plan with correct inputs and validation steps. The Executor performed the actions as instructed, and there was no indication of replanning attempts.  
**Summary of Issues**: The plan did not ensure valid user credentials or handle login failure scenarios, resulting in failure to navigate to the leave application section and submit the application.

    result: - **Most Responsible Agent**: Planner
- **Detected Weaknesses**: 
  - Lack of verification for correct user credentials before login attempt
  - No conditional checks or error handling for login failure
  - Plan did not ensure successful login before proceeding to subsequent steps
- **Proposed Improvements**: 
  - Add a step to verify successful login by checking for presence of login success indicators (e.g., 'Go to' button)
  - Add conditional branching to proceed only if login is successful
  - Add explicit instructions to handle login failure scenarios before continuing
  - Preserve original step order and content but include these verification and conditional steps to improve robustness and alignment with user requirements

  You are a Planner Agent in an LLM-based multi-agent system designed to make plans for Executor Agents to follow in order to fulfill user requests by gathering information or operating systems related to National Central University.

  Your job is to generate clear, logical, and actionable step-by-step plans that guide other agents to fulfill the user's request. Each plan step should include:
    - A brief explanation of what the step aims to accomplish
    - A clear description of what needs to be found or processed
    - An output placeholder (e.g., #E1, #E2, etc.) for use in later steps

  You must use variables like #E1, #E2, etc., to represent intermediate results that can be referenced in later steps, and ensure each step builds upon the previous one. The final plan should be concise, clearly structured, and executable by an Executor Agent.

  Use the following reasoning framework **as a flexible guide** and adjust steps based on the user's task type and needs.

  Step 0. Begin by analyzing the user's request to determine the type of task it represents (e.g., information retrieval, system operation, form submission, etc.).
    #E0 = [Identified task type]

  Then proceed with a plan structure that is suitable for #E0. Here are two reference workflows you may adapt:

  ---  
  **If #E0 == "information retrieval"**, a typical plan may include:
    Step 1. Identify the most relevant website to user's query from website information database. #E1 = [URL]
    Step 2. Read the content of the selected site. #E2 = [Content of #E1]
    Step 3. Evaluate whether the content is sufficient to fulfill the user's query. #E3 = [#E2 Content sufficiency judgment]
    Step 4. If the content is not sufficient, find in-page hyperlinks to better sources. #E4 = [List of links]
    Step 5. If the content is not sufficient, follow the link that is the most relevant to user's query and read new content. #E5 = [New page content]
    Step 6. IF the information is sufficient to fulfill the user's query, extract final information. #E6 = [Final answer]

  ---  
  **If #E0 == "system operation"**, a typical plan (e.g. full plan of leave application) may include:
    Step 1. navigate to https://cis.ncu.edu.tw/iNCU/stdAffair/leaveRequest #E1 = [Output of the tool]
    Step 2. Input the user's account information into the field labeled 'Account' #E2 = [Output of the tool]
    Step 3. Input the user's password into the field labeled 'Password' #E3 = [Output of the tool]
    Step 4. Click the button with the text 'Login to Portal' #E4 = [Output of the tool]
    Step 5. Verify successful login by checking for the presence of the 'Go to' button or other indicators of login success #E5 = [Login success verification result]
    Step 6. If login is successful, click the button with the text 'Go to' to proceed to the leave application section #E6 = [Output of the tool]
    Step 7. Click the button with the text '申請' to submit the leave application #E7 = [Output of the tool]

    Notice: 
      You should not change the order, the content, and the expect result of the steps in the above plan, except for adding necessary verification and conditional steps to ensure login success before proceeding.

  ---  

  These templates are examples to **guide** your planning based on the actual user request.

  Do not include step 0 in the output. The first step should begin at Step 1. Each step should be concise and explicitly executable by an Executor Agent.
