### Summary of Overall Performance
The Execution Team performed well in most steps, particularly in identifying relevant sources and extracting information. However, there was a notable failure to execute Step 5 as planned, which could have provided additional context or information. Future efforts should ensure that all planned steps are executed thoroughly before making decisions to redirect the search.

analyzer:
judgment: - **Step Summary**: Repeat content reading for new hyperlink
- **Problem**: The team planned to read the content of the most promising hyperlink but did not execute this step as they redirected their search.
- **Responsible Agent**: Executor
- **Justification**: The Executor is responsible for executing the planned steps. In this case, the Executor failed to follow through with the reading of the identified links, which was a critical part of the plan. Instead, they opted to search for a term on the main university homepage, deviating from the established plan.
- **Suggested Improvement**: The Executor should ensure to follow through with reading the content of identified links before redirecting the search, as this could provide valuable information.

### Final Judgment
- **Primary Responsible Agent Overall**: Executor
- **Justification for Final Attribution**: The only underperformance occurred in Step 5, which was directly related to the Executor's failure to execute the planned action of reading the content of the identified hyperlink. This deviation from the plan led to a missed opportunity for gathering relevant information, making the Executor the most responsible agent for the overall task outcome.
